```

### Backend (Flask)

The backend is built with Flask and provides RESTful API endpoints for:
- Cryptocurrency data retrieval
- Historical price data
- Volatility metrics
- Correlation analysis
- Sentiment data
- Top gainers information

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using:
- Bootstrap for responsive design
- Chart.js for interactive data visualization
- Custom CSS for theming (light/dark mode)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup
